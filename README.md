# BBQ20KBD Circuit Python Implimentation

# This is a WIP, code and documentation WILL change (and hopefully improve)

# Info:
This is an unofficial implimentation of CircuitPython https://circuitpython.org for the BBQ20KBD by Solder Party https://www.solder.party/docs/bbq20kbd/
Everything here is a sort of mish mash of what I could get working and I wanted to make it public just to get more eyes on it
Feel free to use and adapt anything you see in this repo

# Installation
1. Install CicuitPython: https://circuitpython.org/board/solderparty_bbq20kbd/
2. Copy the python files from this repo onto the device
3. push buttons


Better documentation incomming, I don't have time right now to write a detailed guide
Touch currently doesn't work, sorry
