# BBQ20KBD Circuit Python Implimentation

# This is a WIP, code and documentation WILL change (and hopefully improve)

# Info:
This is an unofficial implimentation of CircuitPython (circuitpython.org) for the BBQ20KBD by Solder Party
Everything here is a sort of mish mash of what I could get working and I wanted to make it public just to get more eyes on it
Feel free to use and adapt anything you see in this repo

# Installation
1. install CicuitPython
2. copy the python files onto the device
3. profit???


Better documentation incomming, I don't have time right now to write a detailed guide
